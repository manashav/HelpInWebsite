                <h2>Lost My Home Due to a Fire</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello. I lost my home due to fire. I am a father of two and I am 
                    currently staying at a motel while I wait for my home to be reconstructed. 
                    I have used all of my savings to fix my house and currently only have money 
                    that will last up to 3 days at most.
                </p>

                <h2>Lost My Job due to pandemic</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello. My name is Katie Ray. I used to be a janitor at a hotel which has closed 
                    down due to covid. I have little to live off of and I need a job to support myself. 
                    Due to the pandemic, I am not able to find another job and have to survive with just
                     my savings.
